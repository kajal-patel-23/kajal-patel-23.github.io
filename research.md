## PeopleWeave (Caesar Research Group)
#####*[Advised by Dr. Matthew Caesar]*
The purpose of this research is to build a data-centered platform that aids researchers, particularly students and rising researchers, network with others at conferences (such as IEEE and ACM) based off their work and research interests. This platform aims to increase inclusion and diversity among researchers and collaborators by emphasizing the works of women and non-binary researchers, among other underrepresented minorities.
