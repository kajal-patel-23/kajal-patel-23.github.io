Hello! I'm Kajal, a Stamps Scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign studying Computer Science in the Grainger College of Engineering. I want to use computer science for social good, so I pursue computational areas that place an emphasis on spreading equity and accessiblity.

## Projects
- MENACE (Machine Educable Naughts and Crosses Engine)

## Work Experience
#### Epic Media Inc.: *Lead Data Analyst and Website Design Intern*
- Built analog artificial intelligence with 304 game‑states to play tic‑tac‑toe to foster personal interest in machine learning.
- Used MENACE to understand the psychology of supervised machine learning through the point of view of both machine and experimenter.
- Crowd‑sourced data by having 100+ people play and train the machine to hone data with the end goal of consistent machine wins.
- Used MENACE to teach machine learning principles and applications through detailed instruction and hands‑on participation.
